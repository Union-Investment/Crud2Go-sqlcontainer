Vaadin SQLContainer for Crud2Go
===============================

Crud2Go uses the [Vaadin SQLContainer Addon](https://vaadin.com/directory#addon/vaadin-sqlcontainer), Version 1.1.

Since some of the changes we had to make did not currently make it into the Vaadin core distribution, you need this
fork of the addon to build [Crud2Go](https://github.com/Union-Investment/Crud2Go).
